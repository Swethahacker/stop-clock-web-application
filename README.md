# stop-clock-web-application
A stop clock is made using html, css and java script.  It uses the setInterval() method to repeatedly update the displayed time at set intervals, effectively simulating the ticking of a stopwatch.  The stop button halts the setInterval() function, freezing the timer, while the reset button clears the variables and resets the display to zero.
