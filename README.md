# stop-clock-web-application
The stopwatch feature in my web application is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  HTML provides the basic structure, including elements for displaying the time (minutes, seconds, milliseconds) and buttons for starting, stopping, and resetting the timer.  CSS styles these elements for a clean and readable presentation.  The core functionality resides in the JavaScript.  It uses the setInterval() method to repeatedly update the displayed time at set intervals, effectively simulating the ticking of a stopwatch.  Variables track the elapsed time, and the start button initiates the timer.  The stop button halts the setInterval() function, freezing the timer, while the reset button clears the variables and resets the display to zero.  This combination of technologies allows for a functional and visually appealing stopwatch within the web application.
